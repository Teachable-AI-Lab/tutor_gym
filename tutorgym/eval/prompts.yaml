    Actions have the following format:
    field;action_type;value

    1. field is the 'id' of the field that the action modifies. 
    2. action_type is one of: {action_types}.
    3. value is the associated input argument of the specified action; this could be of various types including strings, tuples, lists, expressions, etc. For example, the value might be inputs like "No solution", "12", "(12, 24)", or "$$3x + 2$$" depending on the problem state, field, and action.

    Here are some examples of problem states and correct actions for those states:
