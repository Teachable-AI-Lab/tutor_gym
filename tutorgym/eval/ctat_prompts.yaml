6_02_HTML : >
    For these problems you are given a word problem description
    with an equation. Fields Question1 through Question4 ask about the
    value of applying this equation with various inputs.
    If it is not already there, copy the input value into the corresponding
    table cells that end in 'a'. For instance, the input value stated in Question1
    should go in Question1a. The output value from applying the equation will
    go in table cells that end in 'b', like Question1b.
    Use Question1 through Question4 to fill in each table cell.
    Cells can be filled in any order.

6_07_HTML : 
    For these problems you are given a word problem description
    with two numbers that must be added. In any order, fill in each 
    cell of the table (like r1c3) for (row 1, column 3) with the digits of these values.
    The first number in the goes in the first row element prefixed with 'r1', and the second
    goes in the second row prefixed with 'r2'. Each digit goes in the correct
    cell. The hundres digit should go in the c1 column, the tens digit goes in the c2 column,
    the ones digit goes in the c3 column, the decimal point goes in the dp1 and dp2 boxes,
    the tenths digit goes in the c4 column, the hundreths digit goes in the c5 column.
    A trailing 0 can be optionally put in the tenths, hundreths or thousands columns.
    You must also place the + in the 'sign' box.
    After placing the digits in any order, add the numbers together.
    Use the boxes c1 through c5 to carry the tens digits of partial sums of 10 or greater.
    Put each digit of the sum
    in the boxes of row 3, which are prefixed with 'r3'

6_09_HTML : 
    For these problems you are given a word problem description
    with two numbers that must either added or subtracted. In any order, fill in each 
    cell of the table (like r1c3) for (row 1, column 3) with the digits of these values.
    The first number in the goes in the first row element prefixed with 'r1', and the second
    goes in the second row prefixed with `r2`. Each digit goes in the correct
    cell. The hundres digit should go in the c1 column, the tens digit goes in the c2 column,
    the ones digit goes in the c3 column, the decimal point goes in the dp1 and dp2 boxes,
    the tenths digit goes in the c4 column, the hundreths digit goes in the c5 column.
    A trailing 0 can be optionally put in the tenths, hundreths or thousands columns.  +
    You must also place the correct operand + or - in the 'sign' box.
    After placing the digits in any order, add the numbers together.
    If adding use the boxes c1 through c5 to carry the tensdigits of partial sums of 10 or greater,
    If subtracting use the boxes c1 through c5 to borrow across columns.
    Put each digit of the sum or difference
    in the boxes of row 3, which are prefixed with 'r3'.

    Put each digit of the sum in the boxes of row 3, which are prefixed with 'r3'.        

6_15_HTML : 
    For these problems you are given two large values to divide in OV1 and OV2
    If the O1 box is empty select '/' from the combobox
    You must find the largest common power of 10 between the two values and place this 
    value in boxes M1 and M2. Divide OV1 and OV2 by M1 and M2 and place
    the result in S1 and S2. Finally divide S1 by S2 and put the result in A1.

6_27_HTML : 
    For these problems you are given a word problem on scaling factors.
    Express the ratio as a fraction and put the numerator in OV1
    and the denominator in OV1
    place the desired quantity requested in the problem statement in CV1.
    state the ratio as a fraction like 1/12 between the given value and the desired value in SF1.
    scale the denominator value in OV2 by this value and place it in CV2.
    Then copy the value of CV2 to A3.

6_30_HTML : 
    You are given a word problem in the D field.
    Determine if the problem is a Least Common Multiple (LCM)
    or Greatest Common Factor (GCF) problem, and fill the combo box O3 with
    LCM or GCF or depending on your choice.
    Form a ratio between the two values in the problem statement in box D
    and copy the numerator to OV1 and the denominator to OV2.
    Fill in the operand * or / into combo boxes O1 and O2. Fill the
    common multiple or common factor into M1 and M2.
    Apply the operation between OV1 and M1 to get the result numerator and place it in S1.
    Apply the operation between OV2 and M2 to get the result numerator and place it in S2.
    The pairs of boxes (A1, A2), (A3, A4), (A4, A5) ask fill in the blank questions like
    '<A1 value> <blank> <A2 value>' fill in the blank that goes with each of these
    into S3 for (A1, A2), (A3, A4) for S4, and (A4, A5) for S5.

6_34_HTML :
    You need to find the sides of two like triangles.
    The name of the smaller triangle (like Triange ABC) is in box label1.
    The name of the larger triangle (like Triange CDE) is in box label5.
    The names of the sides of the smaller triangle go in boxes label6, label7, and label8.
    The sides of the smaller triangle go in boxes st1, st2, and st3.
    The names of the sides of the larger triangle go in boxes label9, label10, and label11.
    The sides of the larger triangle go in boxes larget1, larget2, and larget3.
    First find the scale factor between the two triangles and copy it into sf1, sf2 and sf3.
    Then fill in the remaining unlocked boxes with the correct side length and side name.

8_19_HTML :
    You are given a grid with an Exponent column, an Expansion column and a value column.
    Fill out the missing values. Each cell in a row has the same number postix like in
    Exponent-2, Expansion-2, and Value-2. For reach row
    fill in the Exponent or Exansion field and then the Value field.
    For instance, if Exponent-1 has 2^3 then fill Expansion-1 with 2*2*2, and value with 8
    and, if Expansion-3 has 3^2 then fill in Exponent-3 with 3*3 then value with 9.

8_20_HTML :
    The expression box holds an expression with two terms in parentheses.
    Take the leading coefficient of the first term and put in box 'cf number 1'.
    Take the leading coefficient of the second term and put in box 'cf number 2'.
    Take the x part of the first term with its exponent and put in box 'cf x1'.
    Take the x part of the second term with its exponent and put in box 'cf x2'.
    Take the y part of the first term with its exponent and put in box 'cf y1'.
    Take the y part of the second term with its exponent and put in box 'cf y2'.
    If there is no coefficient for any of the above steps then just place a 1 in the box.
    Multiply the values in 'cf number 1' and 'cf number 1', put the result in 'cf number 3'.
    Multiply the values in 'cf x1' and 'cf x2', put the result in 'cf x3'.
    Multiply the values in 'cf y1' and 'cf y2', put the result in 'cf y3'.
    Multiply the values in 'cf number 3', 'cf x3', and 'cf y3', put the result in simplified_expression.
